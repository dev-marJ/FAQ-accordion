Logic:

1) When you click on button, menu drops down with text
    1-1) When i click on button, the text appears with toggle option through javascript, when i click again, it disappears
        1-1-1) I have to grab the button and "dropdown-text"

1-2) the display of dropdown-text turns from none to block, followed by animation. 

2) The icon changes from + to - with darker color
3) You can also close this accordion section and - returns to +
4) When you click on any other faq section, previously opened one closes
